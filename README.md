Automating bits and pieces of mathematical algorithms

1) Determinant calculator - calculate matrix determinant using Rule of Sarrus for 2x2 and 3x3 and Laplace expansion for n x n matrices.
2) Gauss-Jordan algorithm - use Gaussian elimination to solve systems of equations.
3) Prime Factors - print all prime factors of a given number.
4) Hoax Numbers - check for hoax number, which is defined as a composite number, whose sum of digits is equal to the sum of digits of its distinct prime factors.
